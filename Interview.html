            LA-based Massima Bell is a music producer, model, dancer, actor, tattooist, and trans activist. Born on a farm in Iowa, she moved to New York at the age of 17 to study postmodern dance at Hunter College before discovering the artist-activist program EMERGENYC, leading to fashion modeling work and her engagement with AIDS-benefit organization Red Hot. That combination of creativity with advocacy, protest, empowerment, and equal rights to healthcare and respect are fundamental to Massima’s life and work. On November 22, 2024, Red Hot releases its 46-track compilation TRANSA, a major 3-year-long endeavor offering nearly four hours of music by more than 100 trans, non-binary, and cisgender artists. Massima co-produced the epic project along with Red Hot’s Dust Reid as a response to increasingly divisive, repressive political rhetoric on trans and non-binary communities. The profits from TRANSA support trans-inclusive organizations.

        <div class="questions">
            
        <p>You live in Los Angeles now, where you’ve been for three years. Can you tell me about being born and raised in Iowa and the experience of discovering your love for movement as a first love? Was that encouraged in your family and community?</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answers">
        <p>I was born on a farm about 15 minutes outside of Iowa City. My dad still lives on that farm and so I still get to go back there and a lot of my family is out there. I grew up kind of all over the US with my mom because my parents divorced when I was quite young. So my experience of Iowa itself was mostly in relation to taking trips out there and spending downtime on the farm, in the fields.</p>
        <p>In terms of movement, my mom really likes ballet and so I did have the experience of taking some classes when I was in middle school, but then with trying to figure out my gender and sexuality and stuff towards the end of middle school and high school, I just kind of shut down physically in my body in terms of wanting to be in that kind of creative movement at all. It wasn’t until I moved to New York City for college when I was 17 that I had the space to re-evaluate what I wanted to spend my time doing, what I wanted to explore, and I decided to just start taking classes at the dance program of Hunter College.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="questions">
        <p>My understanding is that you moved to New York at 17, so that seems to be where you got engaged with music, trans activism, acting, and modeling. Was EmergeNYC a big part of that?</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answers">
        <p>Oh, yeah. That was a program that I was a part of right after I graduated from college. Around that time, I was very much figuring out how I wanted to deal with my own [gender] transition, and to own the way that I needed to relate to the world</p>
        <p>[The EmergeNYC] program was definitely a big stepping stone for me to start to think about the ways that my presence in the world could do things to change it. Or, to use my art practice, that was centered in movement at the time, to try to really affect people with the way that I use my body and put my body in a public space, because we did public performances and staged performances, too.</p>
        <p>At that time, I was thinking a lot about the way that trans bodies get dehumanized in daily interactions. In that program, I was trying to figure out how to use my body, just make my body be in public, in a way that was a response to that dehumanization. I wanted to stop people in their tracks to [push them to] consider the way that they would register a body that they perceive as male, but it’s engaging in feminine truth.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="questions">
        <p>What sort of timeframe are we looking at for those performances, early 2000s?</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answers">
        <p>That was 2014 and 2015. Then, the trajectory of my life did change a lot where I got wrapped up in dealing with my transition, and getting these surgeries that I needed to feel in my body. It was after getting those gender-affirming surgeries, and needing to take a break for months from life basically, because of recovery time and things like that.</p>
        <p>I ended up shifting a lot of the way that my life was structured, and I ended up randomly getting connected to this Mother [Agency, NYC] agent, Timothy Rosado, who I had met through someone else who was part of that EmergeNYC program. And Timothy asked me, “Do you want me to act as your agent, and help you model or something like that?” And I was just so raw and unsure of myself at that point in my life. I was just like, “Okay, I’ll just do whatever. This seems like a thing that I shouldn’t pass up the opportunity to try.” So, modeling became my main work and thing that I was known for.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="questions">
        <p>I know that you went to New York to dance initially, and you got involved in the public performances, then you went through the transition and modeling entered the picture. At what point did music enter the picture, because I’m going to ask about TRANSA?</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answers">
        <p>I have always played music, and always loved music, and that’s always been a part of my life from when I was very little. When I was living in New York, which was up until 2020, I would go to things, and I had a lot of friends and community who made music, and stuff like that.</p>
        <p>I’ve put so much of my heart into this huge musical project that is TRANSA. That happened because I had all this space and time in my life around 2020 and 2021 where I was not in the daily grind of New York, and I had time to consider working with Red Hot [Organization] and with [executive director of Red Hot and co-producer on TRANSA] Dust [Reid] specifically, who asked me to work with them on this project, TRANSA.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="questions">
        <p>How did it begin? Was it an email, or a phone call, or a text? And had you worked with Dust on anything before that?</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answers">
        <p>We met on this short film shoot [in 2020]. I was in this short film [City Bird] about the idea of returning to nature, and connecting with a sense of ourselves beyond just being in the grind of city life. That was on NOWNESS [in 2021], and Dust was friends with the filmmakers. He was on set as a playlist and vibes curator. It was really cute actually, because that whole day I was just talking with Dust about the beauty of the music that they had put together, and a lot of the songs were from artists that were my favorite artists. It was people like Beverly Glenn Copeland, who ended up as one of the key pillars of TRANSA, that we connected on really deeply.</p>
        <p>So, we met on that and then stayed in touch. It was in the beginning of 2021, after the passing of [music producer, and trans activist] SOPHIE, that Dust reached out to me and was like, “Hey, I’ve had the idea of doing something that relates to the trans community through Red Hot.” Dust had made a project with Red Hot before and just reached out to me to see if I would want to concept this thing with them, and pitch this to Red Hot, and try to make it with them. In the beginning of 2021, we started working on that.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="questions">
        <p>How do you like to work on artistic projects? Are you naturally a collaborator or do you like having control over every aspect? And on top of that, how do you deal with conflicting ideas or plans?</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="answers">
        <p>I love collaborating. I think that, in my life, I’ve had the experience of having a really strong, almost spiritual vision of something that I want to make, or that I need to see happen in the world. I’ve often been through a kind of meditative listening to my inner heart, and that’s been a defining process for me.</p>
        <p>In the context of working on this project, I spent a lot of time thinking about it in that same meditative way, but it was this different experience of going in with Dust initially, to kind of concept this whole thing out, and ultimately to do that kind of collaborative work.</p>
        <p>In the process of making this project, we really wanted all the music that we asked for, from specifically the trans artists that we asked, on the project to be something that came from their dreams, and hopes, and desires. So, it was a lot of working with them to just make a dream happen, which is such a beautiful process.</p>

The Territory, a documentary from 2022 that focuses on the fight of the Uru-eu-wau-wau people of the Amazon rainforest against white settlers. In the middle of filming, COVID hits and the Uru-eu-wau-wau themselves take over the cinematography out of necessity, and what results is the most powerful example I’ve seen of taking control of your own narrative and flipping the usual Western documentary script.

The Faggots & Their Friends Between Revolutions by Larry Mitchell, illustrations by Ned Asta, a gay manifesto emerging from communal living in the 1970s that takes you into a fairytale polemic of a new way of life molded in the husk of American empire. The blueprint of possibility.

Jackie Shane Live — It is a tremendous gift to the world that this most transcendent soul singer, Jackie Shane, recorded this live album in 1967, and in these nine songs you can hear her spirit soar—at a time when it was unthinkable to be out as a trans person.

El secreto del río (The Secret of the River, 2024) — A beautiful new Mexican drama on Netflix that revolves around a young trans kid and her relationship to the muxes of Oaxaca, beautifully shot and tenderly told.

Woman and Nature — Reconciliation between humanity and nature won’t be possible until we reckon with the legacy of patriarchy and its disembowelment of (feminine) spirit in every aspect of our society, infused in all the technologies that structure it, from strip mining to the speculum, and in this seminal feminist text from 1978, Susan Griffin lays out in an epic prose poem the intimate connection between women and nature.
